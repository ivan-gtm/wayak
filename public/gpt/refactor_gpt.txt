This function belongs to a bigger script and is called by another functions, keep original function name to avoid errors with the rest of the code.
Be meticulous with scope variables, taking into consideration that global variables could be used by other functions.

function loadTemplates_image() {
    if (DEBUG) {
        console.log("loadTemplates_image()");
    }

    infinites[typeForImages].infiniteScroll("loadNextPage"),
    setTimeout(function() {
        masonrys[typeForImages] && (masonrys[typeForImages].layout(),
        $(".infinite-scroll-request_image_products").show())
    }, 500),
    setTimeout(function() {
        $(imagesContainerSelector).next().find(".loader-ellips").hide()
    }, 1500)
}
