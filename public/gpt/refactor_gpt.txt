This function belongs to a bigger script and is called by another functions, keep original function name to avoid errors with the rest of the code.
Be meticulous with scope variables, taking into consideration that global variables could be used by other functions.

InfiniteScroll.prototype.loadNextPage = function() {
    if (!this.isLoading && this.canLoad) {
        var path = this.getAbsolutePath();
        this.isLoading = !0;
        var onLoad = function(response) {
            this.onPageLoad(response, path)
        }
        .bind(this)
          , onError = function(error) {
            this.onPageError(error, path)
        }
        .bind(this)
          , onLast = function(response) {
            this.lastPageReached(response, path)
        }
        .bind(this);
        request(path, this.options.responseType, onLoad, onError, onLast),
        this.dispatchEvent("request", null, [path])
    }
}

Improve readability and maintainability of this lines of JS code, I'm using "fabric.js" 2.7.0 and "jQuery" 1.12:
Take your time, write functions one by one, if answer is too big.
To start, list only functions name and a number to identify it, DO NOT PROCEED with functions content until user specifies selects a function number.
